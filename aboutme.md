title: About me
subtitle: What gives me the right to have a blog?
---

Ultimately nothing. But I remember how difficult it was to parse dense books on machine learning and statistics as a humanities student. And I remember how unhelpful I found "Hello world"-style Python courses and tutorials in my own autodidactic endeavors. With this blog, I hoped to help others.

My research primarily resides in what is called the digital humanities (DH). This means my work applies computational and quantitative methods to address research questions in humanities disciplines. I have published research in computational bibliography, manuscript studies, and comics studies. I obtained my Ph.D. in English from Northeastern University, after which I held a postdoc appointment with Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. I have worked as a Senior Technical Writer for IBM and Research Software Engineer at Princeton.
