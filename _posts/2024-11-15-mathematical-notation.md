Formulae and equations proliferate every ML paper and textbook. In my experience, these concatenations of alien scrawl are one of the larger barriers of entry to ML research for those not formally educated in mathematics and computer science. These formula are only ostensibly obfuscating however. This post gives a brief overview of the common vocabulary and grammar for mathematical formula used in machine learning (and so probability statistics).

## Syntax
You are undoubtedly already familiar with the mathematical syntax. Remember PEMDAS from elementary school? If not, here is a quick review:

PEMDAS is an acronym denoting mathematical order of operations. It stands for **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication, **D**ivision, **A**ddition, and **S**ubtraction.
